## 📅 [Current Date - e.g., 2024-09-04]

### 🎯 Today's Goals
- [ ] Implement APS metric calculation
- [ ] Test APS with sample data
- [ ] Create initial dashboard layout

### 💻 Work Completed
**Time Spent**: [Hours]

#### APS Metric Implementation
- ✅ Created base measures: Busy%, CPLH, AHT
- ✅ Implemented percentile ranking logic
- ✅ Added weighted calculation for final APS score

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions
**Issue**: RANKX not handling ties correctly in percentile calculation
- **Symptom**: Multiple agents showing same percentile scores
- **Root Cause**: Default RANKX behavior creates gaps for tied values
- **Solution**: Added `Dense` parameter to RANKX function
- **Code**: `RANKX(ALL(Agents), [Metric], , DESC, Dense)`

#### New DAX Code Added
```dax
// Added today - APS base calculation
APS = 
VAR BusyPercentile = RANKX(ALL(Agents), [Busy%], , DESC, Dense) / COUNTROWS(ALL(Agents))
// ... (reference full code in dax-snippets.md)
```

### 🔍 Testing Results
- **APS Score Range**: 0.23 to 0.87 ✅ (within expected 0-1 range)
- **Percentile Distribution**: Verified with manual calculation ✅
- **Edge Cases**: Tested with agents having zero values ⚠️ (needs refinement)

### 🤔 Decisions Made
1. **Dense Ranking**: Chose dense ranking over regular ranking to avoid percentile gaps
2. **AHT Direction**: Confirmed lower AHT = better performance (ascending rank)
3. **Zero Handling**: Will use BLANK() for agents with no data instead of zero

### 📚 Learnings
- RANKX Dense parameter essential for percentile calculations
- Power BI handles BLANK() values better than zeros in visualizations
- Always test edge cases with incomplete data

### ⏭️ Tomorrow's Plan
- [ ] Refine zero/blank value handling in APS calculation
- [ ] Create APS visualization with traffic light formatting
- [ ] Validate APS scores with business stakeholder
- [ ] Start working on team-level aggregations

### 📝 Notes
- Stakeholder meeting scheduled for Friday to review APS implementation
- Need to prepare demo with sample data
- Consider adding APS trend analysis for next iteration
