## Agent Performance Metrics

### APS (Agent Performance Score)
**Category**: Performance  
**Purpose**: Overall weighted performance score for agents  
**Business Owner**: [Stakeholder Name]  
**Created**: [Date]  
**Last Modified**: [Date]

**Components & Weights**:
- **Busy %** (Weight: 0.40) - Heaviest weighting
  - Formula: `busy seconds Ã· total logged seconds`
  - Higher is better (more productive time)
  
- **CPLH - Calls per Logged Hour** (Weight: 0.35)
  - Formula: `handled calls Ã· (logged seconds / 3600)`
  - Higher is better (more calls handled)
  
- **AHT - Average Handle Time** (Weight: 0.25) - Lightest weighting
  - Formula: `average handle time of answered inbound calls (seconds)`
  - Lower is better (faster resolution)

**Final Calculation**: All components ranked as percentiles against all agents, then weighted average applied

**Business Rules**:
- Percentiles calculated using dense ranking
- AHT uses ascending rank (lower time = higher percentile)
- Busy% and CPLH use descending rank (higher value = higher percentile)
- Score range: 0.0 to 1.0

**Usage**: Agent performance dashboards, manager scorecards
